Bash's exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script.
If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0
An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory,
and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.
The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.
